# flutter.deb

A proof of concept to package the Flutter SDK as a Debian package declaring Clang, CMake, GTK+ etc. as dependencies to avoid version conflicts between bundled vs. host libs and tools.

### Build

```sh
$ dpkg-buildpackage 
dpkg-buildpackage: info: source package flutter
dpkg-buildpackage: info: source version 3+git
[...]
dpkg-deb: building package 'flutter' in '../flutter_3+git_amd64.deb'.
[...]
```

### Install

```sh
$ sudo apt install ./flutter_3+git_amd64.deb
